## What are data frames? How are they different from matrices?
**Matrix** - all the elements in a matrix should be of the same type.

**Data frame** - can have elements that are of different types. columns = variables. rows = observations.

R has a built-in package called 'datasets'. You can view a list of datasets in a new tab in Rstudio by calling `data()` function.
```{r included-data}

# look at the structure of the 'mtcars' data set
str(mtcars)
```

Notice that every variable is type "numeric".
